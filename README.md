Score enough points to open the portal to the next level.

Move over the portal and press __Spacebar__ to advance to the next level.

### Enemies

Enemies will not kill you on contact.

Every enemy has an exploitable weakness.

### Score Multiplier

Every enemy you kill increases your score multiplier.

You can also increase your multiplier by picking up a boost.

Getting hit by an enemy will reset your multiplier.

### Bosses

Kill bosses by pushing them into the wall, just like with enemies.

### Conclusion

Every level is a puzzle. If you have trouble, try a different approach.

The game will have challenging moments, but I know you can do it.

I hope you enjoy my game.

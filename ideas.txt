Enemy Ideas:

Impulser - a non-moving turret that you can push around.
Paintball - something that changes which enemies you can hit and what colors the polygons are.
Spinner - angular momentum

Teleport enemies (you can see an indicatior before they appear)

Collecting things. Health? Gold?

Need rewards!!


Special modes:
Obstacles that suck you in.
Colored obstacles that only kill differently colored enemies.
A mode where you can only attract enemies.


EFFICIENCY:
Bounded by number of vertices in boundary polygons of obstacles
Number of shapes (esp polygons) that canvas has to draw every frame


Bosses
Black Hole
Red Swarmer (lots of stunners)


Level Ideas:
Boss Level is every 8th
Each level should have some kind of design/art in its obstacles

One level could be called "BEND" and should focus on a BEND in its obstacles, a strategy point for the player.

TODO - 


Glitch where if not high score, MEDAL won't show.

Then make graphics better.
Get sounds and music.

WASD
